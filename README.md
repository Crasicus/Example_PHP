# Example_PHP

# This was a project that I began as my own initiative to provide our school IT team with a system for pupils to register their devices for technical support.

# This project was approved by the head of IT after I demonstrated my work, however I then started over to create something that closer matched his specifications.

# The follow up was written in C# and is visible in my Example_CSharp repository.
