# Example_PHP

# This was a project that I began as my own initiative. The intention was to provide our school IT team with a system for pupils to register their devices for technical support.

# I demonstrated my work to the head of IT services and he approved the project. However, after discussions with him, I had a better idea of what was required. I started over to create something that closer matched his specifications.

# The follow up was written in C# and is visible in my Example_CSharp repository.
